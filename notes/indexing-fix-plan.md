# SEO Indexing Issue Resolution Plan

## Current Issue
Search Console reports pages not being indexed due to "Page with redirect" issues.

## Identified Potential Causes

### 1. External Form Redirect
- Current: Contact form redirects to external Fillout.com service
- Impact: May cause indexing issues due to external redirect
- Solution:
  1. Add `rel="nofollow"` to form link
  2. Consider embedding form directly using Fillout.com's JavaScript SDK
  3. Add clear documentation for search engines about form functionality

### 2. Schema.org URL Configuration
- Current: Schema markup contains hardcoded URL
- Impact: URL mismatch could cause confusion for search engines
- Solution:
  1. Ensure schema.org URL matches actual site URL
  2. Make URL dynamic or environment-based
  3. Validate schema markup using Google's Rich Results Test

### 3. Navigation Implementation
- Current: JavaScript-based smooth scrolling
- Impact: Could affect crawler behavior
- Solution:
  1. Add proper fallback for non-JS environments
  2. Ensure all navigation links have proper href attributes
  3. Consider implementing static anchors with CSS smooth scrolling

### 4. Service Links Structure
- Current: Some footer service links use "#" placeholder
- Impact: Could cause crawler confusion
- Solution:
  1. Replace "#" links with proper section IDs
  2. Add proper URL structure for service pages
  3. Implement proper internal linking strategy

## Implementation Steps

1. Form Handling Improvements:
   - Add `rel="nofollow"` to Fillout.com form link
   - Update form documentation in schema markup
   - Consider form embedding options

2. URL Structure Updates:
   - Review and update schema.org URL
   - Implement proper URL handling

   - Test across different scenarios

4. Link Structure Cleanup:
